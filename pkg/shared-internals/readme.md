## Common FP - Shared Internals

On npm: `@common-fp/shared-internals`

![Full code coverage](./misc/coverage-badge.svg)

These are the functions used to build the `common-fp` utilities - things like
input assertions and determining the input type.

This package exists because I originally imagined sharing the internals for
other devs to build their own FP utilities. But I've decided to wait on that
because it would take time to refine the API and write documentation.
