## Common FP Org

This is the documentation website for Common FP

My goal is to present the library in a focused way and answer the question,
'Why?' for each utility and the project as a whole. Finally, I built the
in-browser editor so people can try it with little friction.

If something isn't clear or doesn't work like you expect, please let me know
[in Discord](https://discord.gg/N8e7mtfwNM) or
[raise a GitHub issue](https://github.com/common-fp/common-fp/issues/new), and
maybe we can improve the website.
